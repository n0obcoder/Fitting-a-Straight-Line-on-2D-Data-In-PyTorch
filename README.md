# Fitting-a-Straight-Line-on-2D-Data-in-PyTorch
Building a simple Neural Network to solve a Univariate Regression problem in PyTorch

The main focus of this repository is to showcase the flow of building and training a basic Neural Network in PyTorch.


### Step 1: Generating Synthetic 2D Data

### Step 2: Defining the Model Architecture


### Step 3: Defining a Loss Function and an Optimizer


### Step 4: Training the Model and Plotting the Loss
